I'm an ex-Google software engineer based in Canada 🇨🇦. Eager to embark on the next chapter of my career in Japan 🇯🇵, I'm actively seeking new opportunities there.

---

🎓 My academic journey began at the **University of California San Diego**, where I earned both my Bachelor's in **Computer Engineering** and Master's in **Computer Science**. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in Computational Complexity Theory, Computational Learning Theory, and **Machine Learning**. Notably, as a student researcher, I co-authored a [conference paper](/publication/2019-07-10-lakhnes_improving_multi-instrumental_music_generation_with_cross-domain_pre-training) on 8-bit chiptune music generation using **Transformer** models – the very architecture that now forms the backbone of Large Language Models.

💼 With four years of industry experience, including three as a Software Engineer at **Google**, I've gained extensive experience building robust and scalable **backend services**, particularly within Machine Learning training pipelines. At Google, I focused on internal LLM training platforms.

💻 My technical skillset includes proficiency in **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, and **Ruby (Ruby on Rails)**. My time at Google also provided me with familiarity in the **Google Cloud** stack. Beyond the technical side, I am bilingual in **English** 🇺🇸 and **Chinese** 🇨🇳 and fluent in **Japanese** 🇯🇵 (JLPT-N2 equivalent), a skill I'm eager to leverage as I explore new opportunities in Japan.
